Our approach is to let dogs be a little wild when they’re here. Built to house a maximum of 6 dogs, 
your dog will be supervised yet encouraged to get in touch with his or her wild side. Mornings at 
the Ranch start at dawn with breakfast then a trail hike though the forest. After some morning exercise,
they’re let loose in our 5,000 square foot grassy play area to do as they please. Here they can enjoy 
digging to their hearts content, climbing on our hay bail structure, running for balls, splash around 
in the kiddie pool, play chase, or take a lazy nap under the cypress trees. In the afternoon the dogs 
are taken on a second walk around the ranch, along the ridge road, or in the forest.  At sundown, all 
the dogs get to go inside for bedtime where they’ll be treated to cuddles and Kong service in their 
individual “bedrooms” located in our climate controlled indoor facility. 

Because we know you have a busy schedule, we’ve made boarding your dog at the Ranch easier by providing
convenient pick and drop off from your home. While you’re away, we know you’ll be missing your pooch, so
we’ll make sure to send daily emails with pictures and a status update on how he or she is doing. We know
no body wants to leave their dog behind, but we promise you, they’ll be having a blast out at the ranch…
